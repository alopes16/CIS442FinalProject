# CIS442FinalProject

This is a project for my CIS 442 digital forensics class. The goal of this project is to create a program that will iterate through a folder and check both the file signature, and extension of each file. While checking it will compare the two to see if they match. If the extension and signature do not match, it will print the file path of said masquerade file.

To use this program change the "folderPath" variable to the path of the folder you would like to scan. Then run the code and all the information will be printed.

Thanks!
